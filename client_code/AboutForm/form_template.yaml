        <p  style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; font-family: Jost, sans-serif; "><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">My interest in the Judson name began toward the end of the last century when I became president at Judson University in Illinois. Once I encountered the name of Ann and Adoniram Judson I experienced the Yellow Volkswagen syndrome in which people tend to see a particular thing everywhere after noticing it for the first time. Everywhere I looked I saw the name Judson and soon became mesmerized by the abundant notations on this legendary missionary couple.</span></p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; font-family: Jost, sans-serif; "><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">And so, for the past quarter century, I have quietly collected each reference to Ann and Adoniram Judson, important pioneers in the modern missionary movement. This compilation is the result of many years of casually scribbled notes to myself about a missionary couple I have come to admire.</span></p>

        <p style="font-family: Jost, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">If you ask if this compilation is history or trivia or genealogy or story-telling, the answer is yes. The Judsons, have become such an icon that their name is still honored 200 years later. It is a story worth telling and retelling as the compiler of Proverbs reminds us, &ldquo;a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.&rdquo; (Proverbs 22:1)</span></p>

The new constitution for the United States of Americas had been debated, approved and was being implemented when the lad made his appearance on August 9, 1788, the first child of Adoniram Judson, Sr. and his wife, Abigail (nee Brown) Judson. <br><br>\n  \n  Washington became known as the Father of the United States of America. Adoniram Judson, Jr. became known as the father of the modern mission movement from America. <br><br>\n  \n  Over forty biographies have chronicled the life and ministry of Judson as he and his three wives launched the intentional movement of the gospel from the United States to the uttermost parts of the earth. Judson is, and should be, noted as the first foreign missionary from America. Though that status is sometimes debated, Judsonâ€™s influence on the modern mission movement cannot be questioned.\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; margin-top: 20px;\">\n  Birth and early formation of Adoniram Judson\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid #000; padding-top: 10px;\">\n  <sup>1</sup> Originally published in <i>A Noble Company: Biographical Essays on Notable Particular-Regular Baptists in America, Volume 8</i>, Edited by Terry Wolever.
